Toàn bộ project này được làm trong 14 tiếng kể cả thời gian học lại, vì team chúng em đổi ý tưởng khá muộn sau khi nhận được cố vấn của mentor, và app ban đầu bọn em định làm là trên nền tảng mobile chứ không phải web, và chuyên môn bọn em thì lại là mobile. Mong BGK có thể thông cảm với nỗ lực tìm ra ý tưởng và sản phẩm tốt nhất có thể của bọn em.

Đây là link bản prototype của app mà chúng em đã thiết kế trong ngày hôm qua và hôm nay, kính mong BGK xem và cân nhắc: https://www.figma.com/proto/lYtfVZ3UqhjIEE6upuCs00/Untitled?node-id=21%3A197&scaling=min-zoom&fbclid=IwAR0C_BGJM4PoaoMQlmIWY15ysHMQJ6eZL8nxEt1CfRPRVkc_cyrjUdAgSlw

This whole project was built in 14 hours including the time it took us to relearn Full Stack React, since our team changes our product idea very late yesterday afternoon after receiving advice from mentors. We hope judges are sympathetic for us, and considers our design prototype more: https://www.figma.com/proto/lYtfVZ3UqhjIEE6upuCs00/Untitled?node-id=21%3A197&scaling=min-zoom&fbclid=IwAR0C_BGJM4PoaoMQlmIWY15ysHMQJ6eZL8nxEt1CfRPRVkc_cyrjUdAgSlw

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
